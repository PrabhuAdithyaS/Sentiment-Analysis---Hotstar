# Sentiment-Analysis---Hotstar
Problem Statement: Sentiment Analysis on Hotstar and Disney Merger Using NLP & Deep Learning
The merger of Hotstar and Disney has sparked significant discussions across social media, news platforms, and online forums. Understanding public sentiment is crucial for brand perception, customer retention, and business strategy.

This project aims to analyze public sentiment regarding the merger using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning by:

Extracting and preprocessing large-scale textual data from Twitter, news articles, and reviews.
Classifying sentiments into positive, negative, and neutral categories.
Identifying key themes, concerns, and opportunities using topic modeling.
Utilizing transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa) for sentiment classification.
Generating actionable insights to help Disney optimize its communication and business strategy post-merger.
This data-driven approach will assist in understanding audience perception, predicting potential risks, and enhancing customer engagement strategies.
